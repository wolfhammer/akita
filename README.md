Brown Paper Tickets Issue Tracker
=================================

Our goal is to create a browser-based bug report/feature request tracker that BPT devs
can use to manage their work load and assign tasks.

The issue tracker should provide users with a quick and easy way to submit bugs and feature requests
as well as allowing them to view who is assigned to a specific bug/feature request and check on its status.

Users should also be able to post comments on existing issues.

The BPT Issue Tracker will use:
