Akita
=================================

Our goal is to create a browser-based bug report/feature request tracker that Brown Paper Tickets developers can use to manage their work load and assign tasks.

The issue tracker should provide users with a quick and easy way to submit bugs and feature requests as well as allowing them to view who is assigned to a specific bug/feature request and check on its status.

Users should also be able to post comments on existing issues.

Akita uses:

Node.js - Server Engine  
Express - Web framework for Node.js  
Redis  - Session storage and metrics  
Postgres - Data storage  
Foundation 4 - CSS Framework  
Sass / Compass - CSS Precompiler / Library  
Grunt - Build tool
